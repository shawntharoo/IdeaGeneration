Project Objectives

According to the requirements, some of identified  Curtin’s major challenges are: 
• Organizational capabilities are not fully utilized as groups usually work as isolated units. Curtin departments and units are scattered across a large main campus (Bentley). 
• Inefficient mechanisms to capture cost-saving ideas and innovations.
 • No common medium to share innovations and/or ideas.
 • It is difficult to capture the priority problems that are experienced on the frontline, by the staff and students. 
• Inability to contribute to ideas and challenges outside of one’s area or domain.
 • Inability to priorities staff and student innovations and/or ideas for implementation. Getting the right problems are as important as finding the right solutions. 
The things to know are:
 • How can they capture the pressing issues that are experienced across the university?
 • How can they encourage ideation? 
• How can they rank and priorities ideas and innovations? 
• How can they categories ideas and innovations?
 • How can they capture and match problems to ideas? 
Organizations are starting to appreciate the power of the collective and are looking for ways to harness that power. So the objective is to provide suitable working prototype for a solution that would help Curtin staff and students post, exchange, discuss and priorities ideas and innovations. And additionally encourage participation and improvements on submitted ideas and innovations  .
So the project objective is provide the best web based  solution for above matters . This report gives the way how this objective is achieved by describing the user management, user story management in each sprint and summarize  the final product.
